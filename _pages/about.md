Hi, my name is Yichen Li (Chinese: 李亦晨, Japnaese: 李えきしん), a Ph.D. Candidate (2<sup>nd</sup> year student, 2023.09-2028.06) in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), advised by [Prof. Ruixuan Li](https://idc.hust.edu.cn/rxli/index.htm) and [Dr. Haozhao Wang](https://wanghaozhao.mysxl.cn/). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Soochow University in 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaofang Zhang](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/xiaofang-zhang-28262285). I also work closely with [Prof. Rui Zhang](https://www.ruizhang.info/) from HUST, and [Prof. Wenchao Xu](https://huasion23.github.io/) from HKUST. Recently, I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Song Guo](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~songguo/) from HKUST, and [Prof. Shui Yu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Shui.Yu) from UTS. 

## 📖 Research
I am passionate about **distributed learning** among mobile devices. My current research interests focus on five key areas:
- **<ins>⭐ Federated Continual / Incremental / Life-Long Learning</ins>** 
- Federated Learning (**_e.g.,_** Knowledge Distillation, Model Aggregation...)
- (Federated) Recommendation System (**_e.g.,_** Sequential RecSys, Cold-Start Problem)
- (Federated) Software Engineering (**_e.g.,_** Defect Prediction, Code Smell Detection)
- Edge-Cloud Collaboration (**_e.g.,_** Multi-Agent Sys, RAG)
